              <p class="mb-0 text">You are not entering this world in the usual manner, for you are setting forth to be a Dungeon Master. Certainly there are stout fighters, mighty magic-users, wily thieves, and courageous clerics who will make their mark in the magical lands of D&D adventure. You however, are above even the greatest of these, for as DM you are to become the Shaper of the Cosmos. It is you who will give form and content to the all the universe. You will breathe life into the stillness, giving meaning and purpose to all the actions which are to follow.</p>

                  <p class="text">Dungeons and Dragons, also known as D&D is an adventure roleplaying game that takes place between player(s) and their DM (Dungeon master).  For each game session, the DM will have a chance to set the scene and tell the players what is going on and the players relay to the DM what they'd like to do.</p>

                  <h3 class="title">Where would I start?</h3>
                  <p class="text">There are lots of starting options.  You can of course by the main books off of Amazon or practically any bookstore or use an online service such as D&D beyond, but the best way to learn is to play with others.  Try and find a group that you can join in on and learn the ropes.</p>
